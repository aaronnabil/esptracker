Emil Carr	Charles do you have a degree in electronics / computer science or anything?
foo bar	the monospace font in ubuntu is pretty good
MrRolnicek	Btw. the only thing you need to encode in the beam is Beam_ID and the angle by how much it's rotated (just the one angle) right?
MrRolnicek	As in if you're a Valve engineer designing a lighthouse
Emil Carr	That's awesome. I'm considering studying engineering at cambridge, but they dont let you do electronic engineering as well as computing science so i might go to Glasgow Uni and do that
cbryn	cambridge has a good academic track program for computer science and computer engineering
cbryn	if you want to be an \"engineer\" though you can pretty much go anywhere

cbryn	@Emil Carr I misread. Yeah you shouldn't be able to do any combo of EE/CS/CE
cbryn	I mean academic vs. engineer, if you want to be an actual engineer you go wherever is cheapest
El suisse	add the gnuplot commands to the makefile
Peter S. Hollander	yeah, the plot bit
Peter S. Hollander	after my first arrow

CNLohr	\"Pixel Dreams\" by Electro-Light & ProtosoniX Self Published, Distributed Freely
Noob In Life	what is this?
mcd1992	is the timing on the X or Y axis ?
Nayland Smith	That is three streams in 1... audio, video, header
Peter S. Hollander	@CNLohr, can you collect two different streams with the lighthouse set to two different channels?
Peter S. Hollander	That way we could identify the lighthouse ID if it is separate / repeating in the stream...
Nayland Smith	header on left (thin), middle video, right audio?
juntistik	it's not streaming a/v
Peter S. Hollander	There's a paperclip button on the back
juntistik	this is just light data
Nayland Smith	but JUST like it....
MrRolnicek	Each new line comes in once per rotation of lighthouse or twice?
Peter S. Hollander	Only way to confirm is via SteamVR with a 2.0 tracked object......
Peter S. Hollander	I believe.
Peter S. Hollander	So just press it once and hope? ^_^'
juntistik	It means its just for sync right? handshaking ?
CNLohr	\"Shadows\" by It's Different Published by NoCopyrightSounds Amazon.com Song ID: 288331452
Peter S. Hollander	You were generating a lot of noise when moving the lighthouse (stopping due to IMU?)
Peter S. Hollander	Huh. That's interesting.
Peter S. Hollander	Are they both at the same starting point?
juntistik	Is the lighthouse running by itself or syncing with the second one?
Rikard	What is lighthouse
MrRolnicek	There is no sync in the 2.0s as far as i know, they don't care about each other or anything else
juntistik	Valves positional tracking for VR
gamerpaddy	generates new encryption key on channelswitch? maybe rec data while powering up / connecting
Peter S. Hollander	The image files - can we write a filter that doesn't start plotting the data until a specific stream is met, so they have the same starting point and are directly comparable?
CNLohr	\"Wouldn't Change It\" by Halvorsen Published by NoCopyrightSounds Amazon.com Song ID: 266782879
Peter S. Hollander	DM'd you on twitter w/ a tweet from Alan last week
yrath	what's the type/spec of the PC you are using? seems to handle those superspeed slurps without any detrimental effect to your desktop environment.
Peter S. Hollander	Got it, I can tweet to you then directly
CNLohr	\"Lights\" by Ikson Music by: https://www.soundcloud.com/ikson
Peter S. Hollander	Publicly tweeted
Peter S. Hollander	\"can only handle the bits 2 and 3 stream\" implies that there are 3 bits that show a lighthouse ID?
Peter S. Hollander	Unless he meant bits 2 and 3 of your stream. That's probably what he meant. Nevermind.
facelessindividual	Hi Peter!
1dfgaJ83K92	Plz can you explain the output, as i missed the beginning of the stream.
CNLohr	\"Sugar High\" by JJD Obtained from the-arcadium.net JJD: https://soundcloud.com/jjdofficial
juntistik	doesn't look like the light house has anything to sync with
Peter S. Hollander	FYI \"1 time around the rotor\" may be skewed from busting open the lighthouse! I found that the duty cycle lasted somewhere around 0.020123 seconds rather than the expected / ideal 0.02!
juntistik	doesn't it sync with the headset sensor?
juntistik	whats the point of the data stream then?
1dfgaJ83K92	How are you syncing the lines of data with the rotor rotation??
Tacit Tacet	moob
MrRolnicek	So the information about the angle is \"encrypted\" or \"encoded\" by the beam ID? That would make sense, right?
Rikard	Gotta love them proprietary protocols.
Jamie Christie	So a horiz row of pixels represents the data from one sweep of the lighthouse - is that right. (hi everyone, Just arrived).
WORMSTweaker	I'm not sure,but on the left,when you were swapping the pictures,the data seemed reversed (0 beacames 1, and vice-versa)
juntistik	cray-zee
Peter S. Hollander	Can you also post your code? Would love to play around with the dimensions myself as well
CNLohr	\"Early Hours\" by Ikson Music by: https://www.soundcloud.com/ikson
Emil Carr	WORMSTweaker that would be called inverted
Peter S. Hollander	btw, how did you determine the width of the image @CNLohr?
MrRolnicek	Do we know how good is the horizontal resolution of the 2.0 system? Because that SHOULD tell uss where the information is going to repeat with a different data payload, right?
Chad Doebelin	Hi, not trying to be disrespectful here, but what's the point? I'm not really using my imagination I guess, but what do envision being able to do once you've understood the data?
Peter S. Hollander	Okay!
Chad Doebelin	alrighty, thanks!
CNLohr	\"Time Lapse\" by TheFatRat Freely available from TheFatRat Obtained from the-arcadium.net https://lnk.to/tfrtimelapse
Jamie Christie	How many pixels (bits) are in a sweep?
Tacit Tacet	so each picture is a channel/lighthouseID.. how many lighthouse is supported (max no of \"images\")?
juntistik	I hope we get a video of the manufacturing line for these things like got with the steam controller
RoterFruchtZwerg	do we know if one line in the image is all data of one revolution of the rotor, or just one beam? the rotor generates two beams per revolution, right?
1dfgaJ83K92	How many lines per rotation / what is the angle per line of data?
Continuum	how does the beam height (in effective pixels) compare to what looks like a narrow/wide data sample?
Peter S. Hollander	@CNLohr can we get two raw data dumps each with it's own unique uninterrupted channel when you next upload?
1dfgaJ83K92	Can you break your data up into sweeps with a big gap in the image??
CNLohr	\"Unit F (VRC6)\" by Inverse Phase Visit http://inversephase.bandcamp.com
Peter S. Hollander	One of the files you are working with IIRC you toggled the channel in the middle of the data gather? Looking for two separate uninterrupted streams specifically
juntistik	Do you have any interest in getting knuckles to RE I guess a watchman 2.0 protocol?
1dfgaJ83K92	Split the image into individual sweeps. rather than multiple sweeps with no gaps.
Peter S. Hollander	I think that would let us see a repeated lighthouse ID?
Peter S. Hollander	If present
MrRolnicek	The ID can be mixed in with the other data
Peter S. Hollander	Ohhhhh, that would be sneaky. And terribly inconvenient for us
CNLohr	\"C64est\" by Inverse Phase Visit http://inversephase.com
Peter S. Hollander	*crosses fingers*
MrRolnicek	There could still be a repeating pattern of \"start\" and \"end\" of a segment that deliniates a specific position of the rotor within the rotation ... maybe
Jamie Christie	The last lighthouse had a horrible \"forward and backward\" encoding, IIRC. I remember you screaming on camera...
Peter S. Hollander	Alan said that there is no packaging of the data iirc
Peter S. Hollander	So no preamble or anything
1dfgaJ83K92	How many bits is a line of data?
MrRolnicek	That was the Vive controller I think
MrRolnicek	The one that was encoded forwards and backwards
Peter S. Hollander	We should be able to understand where in the stream we are with only \"tens of bits\", per Alan (that is the point, after all)
MrRolnicek	tens of bits is WAY too short ... there has to be some trick to that

L V	and FFT of Random data doesn't provide enough information about a random process
Emil Carr	So im guessing by fft you mean something like 1 bit = 1 unit of time?
mcd1992	lol
MrRolnicek	There's probably some simple FFT in numpy, do you do python at all?

1dfgaJ83K92	I feel like I'm in the matrix looking at the png data you uploaded... but scrolling from left too right quickly there is a distinct separation between two layers.
L V	first try doing an autocorrelation of the data, and later an FFT of the autocorrelation function obtained.
Emil Carr	never really seen fft used outside of audio
1dfgaJ83K92	Plz can you upload an image of the data with black bars separating the data into individual sweeps.
Peter S. Hollander	Charles, I just want to thank you for how beautiful this new data is. I'm running a find command for a string of 5000+ bits and there are 10 matches in 1 second ❤
Brittany B	hackity hackering
Peter S. Hollander	I can't see any noise, this is so wonderful to work with haha
Lenard Mollenkopf	What even is Lighthouse?

N!cky	feels weird when youre watching someone live with 6 hours time difference
1dfgaJ83K92	So each vertical line is a full 180 Degree sweep??
mcd1992	@1dfgaJ83K92 the X axis is time, Y axis is the data
MrRolnicek	Where is the data actually? I might want to take a look at it if my internet can manage to download it.
mcd1992	or sweep, sorry. Just meant not time

Shahruk Hossain	autoCorr(L) = sum( x(t) * x(t-L) ) for all t and where L is the lag time; If it's truly random, you'd get a spike at L=0 and close to zero every where else
1dfgaJ83K92	So is each vertical line one rotation?
John Donovan	Each long line is one sweep
CNLohr	\"Energetic Fist (Stage Theme)\" by Inverse Phase Visit http://inversephase.bandcamp.com
Emil Carr	need to include rfftw.h
MrRolnicek	And keep in mind this isn't the data that a sensor can see, this is ALL the data the laser puts out
1dfgaJ83K92	@John Donovan Long line being horizontal in the image?
John Donovan	Do we know if there's any other data in the stream apart from the lighthouse id?
John Donovan	Yup

1dfgaJ83K92	Do you know the angular resolution of the lighthouse??
atzkey	Did you try binvis dot io for analysing file entropy.

mcd1992	Doesn't binwalk have some entropy mode?
Perlmongler	Hey Charles
Peter S. Hollander	😎
Perlmongler	oh
Perlmongler	I guess i Am late to the party
Perlmongler	What di we learn today?
L V	Check this ebook later, it provides codes in c for FFT and correlation \" Introduction to Signal Processing By Sophocles Orfanidis\"
Perlmongler	So what was the data. i missed probing it from the lighthouse directly. Can any one catch me up?
N!cky	line 25
John Donovan	@Perlmongler that the engineers at Valve are just as fiendish as when they worked on the previous lighthouse

L V	The correlation gives a vector where the peaks..
Peter S. Hollander	What would that imply? Bad data? Or \"random\" seed?
1dfgaJ83K92	looking at the png data what are the slightly blank horizontal lines?
Peter S. Hollander	I mean, if it's that close to being pure entropy, then I think it's safe to say that Ben was VERY efficient about how the information is encoded... xD
Perlmongler	Thats what i theroised it was
Perlmongler	thats how encoders works

shinevision sv	Bye! was fun!
shinevision sv	😀
Emil Carr	damn i was actually wondering if it was an LFSR
shinevision sv	WOT
shinevision sv	Plot Twist
MrRolnicek	link it?
John Donovan	Mind blown! I was also thinking about LFSR just now!
