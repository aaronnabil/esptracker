Kapteeni Krisu	Will you lower the music volume a bit? Even with ducking it's difficult to pick your voices up.
SolaLupus	the music is kinda loud....
derstreber2	yeah seems a bit loud
Jason Spriggs	workin on it
Major Gnuisance	yup, it's too loud
derstreber2	either that or talking to quit
tommihommi1	kinda loud is a bit of an understatement

Jason Spriggs	test chat
Josiah Tillett	@Blue Speck I believe the IR filter was removed, he said earlier that he modified the camera.
Comgenie	we're back!
Maxjoker98	I think most sensors are IR sensitive. They usually just have a IR filter.
Ben Jackson	LH2.0 reverse engineering. This is going to be amazing
Ben Jackson	I don't like popcorn but I am baking bread
schalotten	the two lasers are arranged in a 90deg angle. that way you don't deed the flash to sync
Blue Speck	Would love to see the procure for that, I seem to have a similar DSLR. Last time I did that was on a webcam, it was just a piece of glass
swifterik	Ben arrived üëèüëè
tommihommi1	@blue speck that's a mirrorless
expansiongames	im curious how error tolerant the data stream is
Peter S. Hollander	That would mean there would be a limitation on the range at which you can use them at. Arc length needs to sweep for long enough to encode the binary data.
Blue Speck	indeed.
SolaLupus	woooh, now its vive livestream üòÄ
Peter S. Hollander	Curious to see if that is the case.
CNLohr	\"Home\" by Jordan Schor & Harley Bird Published by NoCopyrightSounds Amazon.com Song ID: 291848222
tommihommi1	I think you mean they use on/off keying to encode the data, of course the data itself is binary, we don't use other digital systems in computers
SolaLupus	would it be possible to encode the angle of the lighthouse emittor at every point of its rotation?
swifterik	no way
Peter S. Hollander	Well, there's a chance that it's actually an analogue signal being sent to communicate time signatures.
Comgenie	Trippy
tommihommi1	technically yes, but the sensors are too bad for it
Peter S. Hollander	Playback.
swifterik	GREEN
Comgenie	It is green for us
Nikky Snow	all green ?
Peter S. Hollander	No they aren't - the documentation for the sensors references analogue measurement, IIRC.

CNLohr	\"Unity\" by TheFatRat Freely available from TheFatRat Obtained from the-arcadium.net https://lnk.to/tfrunity
Ben Jackson	Charles should make a sampling camera to do ultra-high speed photography of repetitive stuff
MobiusHorizons	i'd be interested to see what that does at 240fps
SolaLupus	@tommihommi1 we have his address üòâ
tommihommi1	using a phone is a good idea, most don't have ir filters
Jernej Jakob	I remember my gopro used to do 200+ fps
Peter S. Hollander	Erm, can't post links. Google \"triad_semi_ts4231_datasheet_rev_a.pdf\", first result should be the datasheet for the 2.0 sensors.
Peter S. Hollander	Affirmative
Comgenie	yep
SolaLupus	yes
swifterik	Indeed we can
expansiongames	but do we want to
Peter S. Hollander	(I'm a SteamVR hardware licensee. Very familiar with 1.0 systems, have already built stuff with 2.0, but have yet to test anything with 2.0 base stations)

mcd1992	ayy is yours doing that as well when steam closes?
mcd1992	xorg freezes up for some reason
rpavlik1	does your base station 2.0 make an annoying whine at about 3.6kHz?
Peter S. Hollander	LOL
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr have you messed with the tinyfpga? seems like it might be a great diagnostic tool for things like this?
Peter S. Hollander	It was after my Synapse training
Peter S. Hollander	I wanted to prove to myself I could make SteamVR hardware from start to finish
Peter S. Hollander	So I wanted something practical to make
Peter S. Hollander	So mug it was
swifterik	Immersive mug VR
Peter S. Hollander	all-nighter in my college dorm room ^_^'
Jason Spriggs	Very nice!
Peter S. Hollander	The hardware I'm working on now is Talaria VR - pressure sensing locomotion hardware for your feet!
tommihommi1	so you can sit at your desk and drink coffee in VR
MobiusHorizons	git submodule init
tommihommi1	while sitting at your desk and drinking coffee Irl
MobiusHorizons	git submodule update
Peter S. Hollander	I used it for drinking water after cardio games, like Audioshield, without taking off the HMD
Josiah Tillett	@Peter S. Hollander Is that the one with the bowl shape that tracks your movements without actually moving?
rpavlik1	submodule update --init --recursive
tommihommi1	that's actually a reasonable application
Peter S. Hollander	No, we were approaching something like that in an earlier design, but now it's foot-mounted wearables. Walk in place, translates to motion in VR
MobiusHorizons	that looks more like a carrier
Ben Jackson	licensees don't know either
CNLohr	\"Time Lapse\" by TheFatRat Freely available from TheFatRat Obtained from the-arcadium.net https://lnk.to/tfrtimelapse
Peter S. Hollander	Haha, hi Ben
Ben Jackson	yes, that's fine
rpavlik1	so I know the guy who designed the chip, dunno if he'll spill the beans
tommihommi1	pogchamp
Ben Jackson	the datasheet has the timings
tommihommi1	#JustESP8266Problems
rpavlik1	(the guy at Triad Semi)
Ben Jackson	yes, for how to configure the chip
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr, what's the frequency of the pulse?
MobiusHorizons	basically how high of a resolution do you have on that pulse?
Ben Jackson	the config word isn't that interesting. it's just a way to make adjustments to the chip after the fab. so you would need to know lots of internal details to know what the bits do
CNLohr	\"Sugar High\" by JJD Obtained from the-arcadium.net JJD: https://soundcloud.com/jjdofficial
Ben Jackson	instead of making a bunch of variants of the chip
Ben Jackson	but once you figure out what it should be, the other values aren't that interesting anymore
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr, My first guess seeing that waveform is that the data is the encoded as irregularities in the waveform
Peter S. Hollander	Hey Ben, are there plans to update the HDK documentation with a system overview on 2.0 Tracking? Was nice to have a standard reference to go back to when making 1.0 hardware
MobiusHorizons	ie a 1 is probably 0110 vs 010 or something like that
Ben Jackson	I think there are updates coming, but I don't know if that's in the update
MobiusHorizons	just to check that theory, can you display the data alternating every other bit
rpavlik1	is it something like nrzi?
Peter S. Hollander	Alrighty
Ben Jackson	FYI @CNLohr that capture doesn't look right to me
MobiusHorizons	ah, alright then
CNLohr	\"Campfire\" by RetroVision Published by NoCopyrightSounds Amazon.com Song ID: 288331460
MobiusHorizons	do you have any kind of scope to look at the data with?
SolaLupus	^^
MobiusHorizons	FPGA?
AdamCarter MI5	I loveeee this
tommihommi1	right, just looking at the raw analog data with a scope would be fun
MobiusHorizons	meaning, could you use that datalogger thing you built with the FPGA for this?
Ben Jackson	it's hard to look at raw analog photodiode signals
MobiusHorizons	OOOH
Ben Jackson	you need an amplified photodiode with more bw
Ben Jackson	@CNLohr that was re the chat
Ben Jackson	@CNLohr how fast is the ESP sampling?
Jernej Jakob	could you do something with a sfp optical reciever?

CNLohr	\"Monody\" by TheFatRat fat. Laura Brehm Freely available from TheFatRat
MobiusHorizons	what chip are you talking to again?
Peter S. Hollander	Max input freq is 10 MHz
Ben Jackson	you should probably move the base and the sensor farther apart
Peter S. Hollander	Ctrl-F \"freq\" üòÇ
rpavlik1	(there is something mechanical in there that is 3.6KHz or multiple thereof, fwiw)
MobiusHorizons	try it with the basestation off, what does it look like?
Ben Jackson	@MobiusHorizons good idea
rpavlik1	yeah they communicate with each other. blue light turns white when they are in good mode, just like old ones
Ben Jackson	they don't communicate with each other
Maxjoker98	flickering lights maybe?
rpavlik1	hmm. they just appear to then apparently
Ben Jackson	they're blue while spinning up
rpavlik1	I'm not a licensee so he wins, all I have is observations
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr what does it look like when the lighthouse is off?
mcd1992	have these ever been tested with a HMD ?

MobiusHorizons	can you ever have enough cables?
motico core	no
Ben Jackson	@CNLohr are you sure you powered up and configured the sensor properly?
derstreber2	bringing out the big guns, in this case a supersoaker
Ben Jackson	that can make it tricky to just measure the output
Ben Jackson	b/c you still need active config
MobiusHorizons	@derstreber2 LOL
Ben Jackson	you could have glitched it into sleep mode
tommihommi1	when in doubt:
Maxjoker98	Still maybe a lightsource? LED lights, screen(backlights)
tommihommi1	have you tried turning it off and on again
tommihommi1	and use a pringles can to shield against all other light sources
Ben Jackson	wait, are you reloading the ESP on every run?
Ben Jackson	and each run it tries to configure the already-configured sensor?

MobiusHorizons	BEN SAID AN IMPORTANT THING
Christian Ivarsson	Hello, guys üòÉ
Ben Jackson	after you configure the sensor it's in a different mode
Ben Jackson	the initialization sequence won't work then
Mark Murnane	we need a talking banana to read the chat allow
tommihommi1	windows is not secure, period.
Mark Murnane	We need a talking banana to read the chat aloud.
Maxjoker98	A bananna for the chat?!
Ben Jackson	don't drive the D/E lines again after config or you will do unpredictable things
Ben Jackson	so power cycle, send config sequence, D/E go hi-Z and stay hi-Z as long as you want to use it
Ben Jackson	if you have to drive those during a reload you should powercycle the sensor

Josiah Tillett	@Mark Murnane We've already done that, it's about 4 feet away now.
Ben Jackson	you probalby have a local reflection
Ben Jackson	a shiny bit right near the sensor
Ben Jackson	like a connector
Peter S. Hollander	Ooooooo
Ben Jackson	no SUPER local
Ben Jackson	like on the board with the sensor
tommihommi1	oh
Peter S. Hollander	Got any solder globs or something?
tommihommi1	black tape
Ben Jackson	or just move the base way farther away
Ben Jackson	yeah black gaffer tape isn't great for IR
Peter S. Hollander	Did you identify something like a connector close to the sensor?
Jernej Jakob	sharpie
Ben Jackson	sharpie is also terrible in ir
tommihommi1	what about electrical tape
CNLohr	\"Nostalgia\" by Tobu Free download: https://tobu.io/Nostalgia Amazon.com Song ID: 276438878
Ben Jackson	the first step to blocking IR is to realize your intuition for what color or transparency things are in IR is shit
Peter S. Hollander	What do you usually use to block IR, Ben?
Peter S. Hollander	lol
majcherek128	Use aluminum foil?
Max Bambusman	vinyl electrical tape ?
Ben Jackson	for not reflecting we have some special matte black optical tape that's black in IR
Ben Jackson	and for blocking transmission you really need foil backed tape
Max Bambusman	@Ben Jackson aluminium duct tape?
Ben Jackson	that will definitely block it
Ben Jackson	but then it's a mirror
Ben Jackson	the tape we use has foil lining but it's black on the outside
Ben Jackson	blue painters tape is almost entirely transparent in IR, fyi
tommihommi1	what about shrink tube
Jernej Jakob	all i know is trash bags are transparent in ir, thanks to mythbusters
Max Bambusman	ahh i see, sorry its the next day of my graduation for me xD
Peter S. Hollander	Huh, good to know
Naters305	I love how ben just gives subtle hints and doesnt completely give away how it works
tommihommi1	yay
Peter S. Hollander	And env is determined when the beam signal is bright enough, yes?

pacccer	what about clear tape?
pacccer	might block ir
Josiah Tillett	We found good tape, thanks Adam!
tommihommi1	just take the camera and run around until something looks black
Peter S. Hollander	@CNLohr re testing - First thing I'd say would be to very stably secure the base and the TS4231 and confirm that at those static positions we get a reliable and repeatable datastream?
Peter S. Hollander	lol yes for sure
tommihommi1	the only reliable electrical tape is the 3m stuff, everything else ages really badly
Peter S. Hollander	just once you do start collecting data, if that'll be today
Ben Jackson	I'm going to laugh so hard when you figure out what this bitstream is
tommihommi1	help cant see shit help
Peter S. Hollander	Oh no, that makes me feel like we're hella overanalyzing it haha
Ben Jackson	understanding the bits should be straightforward
Ben Jackson	or rather demodulating them
Peter S. Hollander	Damn, I want some 2.0 bases now to keep figuring this out xP
tommihommi1	I love OOK, just for the name
Ben Jackson	but figuring out what they are might be a crueler challenge than the old wireless protocol
zpeef	what's the goal today?
Peter S. Hollander	SteamVR hardware dev
Josiah Tillett	1) Unboxing, 2)Trying to read the bitstream 3) Doing something with it.
tommihommi1	just google ben jackson valve :P

Jernej Jakob	that's what you get for buying stuff from china, I guess
tommihommi1	I'm talking about the openlab Augsburg
tommihommi1	so no
Mark Murnane	Does the new lighthouse stop transmitting if you move it too abruptly like the old one? Do you think we could spin it the other way at 3000 RPM to stabilize the beam?
pacccer	ah
Peter S. Hollander	Haha, woah
Ben Jackson	they stop transmitting when the motor control loop goes out of spec
pacccer	Hello Openlab from Labitat in denmark üòâ
Jernej Jakob	he has the fx3 version of mine
mcd1992	the music seems to be getting louder again?
Ben Jackson	so in theory if you spun the outside at -50rpm very constantly it would work
Ben Jackson	but your outside motor control loop would need to hold about 200ppm tolerance
Jernej Jakob	-50hz (3000rpm)
Mark Murnane	Hmmm
tommihommi1	ccc(dot)de/en/updates/2018/hausdurchsuchungen-bei-vereinsvorstanden-der-zwiebelfreunde-und-im-openlab-augsburg
Jernej Jakob	which is conveniently the european ac mains frequency
Ben Jackson	yeah, I never thought about how hard this would be to reverse engineer from snippets
tommihommi1	it's an English article even though the url is german
MobiusHorizons	\\
Maxjoker98	Oh well. Hi anyway from the /dev/tal in Wuppertal üòÄ
CNLohr	\"Blue Sky\" by Ikson Music by: https://www.soundcloud.com/ikson
Mark Murnane	I wonder what you'd get if you put a diffuser across the entire face of the lighthouse and put the ts4231 next to that.
Ben Jackson	interesting idea
Peter S. Hollander	I'd worry that the diffuse signal wouldn't be bright enough anymore to be significant
Ben Jackson	or point it into an integrating sphere
Jernej Jakob	that's a cool idea, Mark
Maxjoker98	Maybe because of the rotation of the 2 beams and the close prxoimity it's getting extra data
MobiusHorizons	\\ /
MobiusHorizons	darn chat won't let me draw ascii art
tommihommi1	wouldn't the esp32 be much faster for this stuff, it clocks way higher
Ben Jackson	@CNLohr you didn't forget about power cycling if you want to reconfigure, right?
MobiusHorizons	could you use mirrors on the side to keep the beam in view longer
Ben Jackson	you should just power it with a fet so you can toggle it in the boot sequence
Jernej Jakob	the diffuse light source would pose less of a problem for reflections
tommihommi1	how much current does the ts need?
Ben Jackson	@MobiusHorizons the shape of a flashlight beam reflector has the properties you want (i.e. it kind of collimates light)
pacccer	tommihommi1, not even is the esp32 faster, but it probably also has peripherals that could help taking the load off the cpu, like the hardware counters etc.
CNLohr	\"Atlas (Alpha 9 Remix)\" by Faux Tales Obtained from the-arcadium.net Listen here: https://goo.gl/2d9h4t
MobiusHorizons	@Ben Jackson that's pretty much what I was thinking
SolaLupus	who is the one breathing to the mic ? üòÄ
tommihommi1	NotLikeThis
mcd1992	also somone is right up on the mic
MobiusHorizons	but actually Mark's idea of a difuser might be easier
Ben Jackson	what, you don't want to build an integrating sphere?
pacccer	yeah, whats up with the heavy breating into mic? üòõ
pacccer	someone snoring in the background? üòõ
Jernej Jakob	ASMR
Peter S. Hollander	@CNLohr is your code for interfacing the TS4231 available online?
pacccer	no worries, it was subtle
tommihommi1	neat
Josiah Tillett	@Peter S. Hollander Charles' github @ esptracker
Peter S. Hollander	Thank you!
pacccer	@CNLohr doesn't the esp have a bunch of interrupts like wifi interrupt that disturbs the sampling? or have you disabled them during sampling?
CNLohr	\"Last Summer\" by Ikson Music by: https://www.soundcloud.com/ikson
MobiusHorizons	would some combination of foil + tape work to do what your hand was doing?
Peter S. Hollander	@CNLohr you might not get the envelope signal with the diffuse approach - it responds to light intensity crossing a threshold, per the docs
Mark Murnane	He uses hardware to do DMA
pacccer	ah, got it üòâ
Peter S. Hollander	Yeah, I agree
Mark Murnane	I'm assuming that we don't care about the envelope, and that all sensors are sampling a chunk of the same bitstream.
Peter S. Hollander	IR Diffuse***
Mark Murnane	Or just aim the lighthouse at the wall and use that as a diffuser.

mcd1992	plastic bag ?
tommihommi1	wall OP pls nerf
Ben Jackson	I love the juxtaposition of how clever an idea that is vs how much it will not help you at all :)
mcd1992	mood killer
MobiusHorizons	please continue
Peter S. Hollander	Pro'lly the wall.
Ben Jackson	how much of a hint do you want
Ben Jackson	the wall would work
Peter S. Hollander	Maybe a diffuse reflector?
Peter S. Hollander	Hahaha
Peter S. Hollander	@CNLohr the wall will work, the data we get won't be useful compared to a single frame capture is I think what he's getting at.
Peter S. Hollander	There won't be anything useful about getting the diffuse data?
Ben Jackson	oh, no, the wall will be more useful
Ben Jackson	wall is strictly a good idea and an improvement over short captures
Ben Jackson	and you will easily figure out 1s vs 0s
tommihommi1	this is basically an escape the room scenario with ben skirting around the edge of trying to make it fun without spoiling it
CNLohr	\"Station Report (Extended Intro)\" by Inverse Phase Visit http://inversephase.bandcamp.com
Peter S. Hollander	Oh, okay - were you not talking about the wall when you said \"it\" won't help at all?
Ben Jackson	right
Ben Jackson	I mean having a longer sequence of bits won't help you
Peter S. Hollander	Oooookay
pacccer	its kind of like watching saw and ben \"wants to play a game\" üòõ
Peter S. Hollander	Gotcha..
Peter S. Hollander	also @pacccer lol
ibrahim abukharmeh	Get an intel wireless card for 5 dollar or something üòõ It looks you wireless card linux drivers are terrible.
Ben Jackson	üòÉ üòÉ :)
Peter S. Hollander	A longer sequence of bits will likely just reveal to us that the bits repeat.
Peter S. Hollander	But
Peter S. Hollander	well no
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr are you logging the chat?
Peter S. Hollander	they have to encode timing somehow
MobiusHorizons	(might be a good idea)
tommihommi1	how about we find out what the encoding is, that should be easy enough
Ben Jackson	so @Peter S. Hollander has decided to start cutting off his leg with the saw ;-)
CNLohr	\"C64est\" by Inverse Phase Visit http://inversephase.com
MobiusHorizons	um what?
Peter S. Hollander	üòÇ
Praxis	Just export it out of saelae.
Peter S. Hollander	How else can you encode the time signature / sweep angle into the data..?
pacccer	is there what, 3 different lengths of pulses?
Max Bambusman	@Ben Jackson how much do you/steam want the vive to be reverse engineered?
pacccer	salae might possibly even be able to decode the stream
MobiusHorizons	enough to give one to cnlohr...
pacccer	hahah
Mark Murnane	In this episode, Charles goes bankrupt.
Peter S. Hollander	hahaha
CNLohr	\"A Blip in Space (Miniboss)\" by Inverse Phase Visit http://inversephase.bandcamp.com
Josiah Tillett	boom
Blue Speck	or discovers torrents.
Praxis	Manchester?
Ben Jackson	when I designed it originally I started by capturing with saleae and decoding w/ python
Ben Jackson	it will export to CSV
Ben Jackson	then I wrote a saleae plugin to demodulate which is fun
Peter S. Hollander	Haaaahahahaa
Peter S. Hollander	Get the saleae!!
Peter S. Hollander	I'm starting to think the datastream is just the lighthouse identifier code... And the ID is short enough to be captured within 1 envelope at whatever the max tolerable range is
tommihommi1	rtlsdr
Peter S. Hollander	But of course that begs the question of how is the beam angle telegraphed to the device.
pacccer	@CNLohr not gonna' happen - read bens comment
ibrahim abukharmeh	Sigrok ?
Mark Murnane	When you say beam angle do you mean the motor angle or which lense the beam is passing through?
MobiusHorizons	i would imagine the angle is encoded as a rising sequence
Max Bambusman	@Peter S. Hollander Magic
CNLohr	Error opening file: No such file or directory Unknown track by Unknown artist Unknown copyright information.
Jernej Jakob	missing a zero?
tommihommi1	do you believe in magic
Praxis	My guess is its another timestamp. That would make sense.
Peter S. Hollander	And Ben's cryptic answers are making me start to question if the beam angle is even flipping necessary anymore or if you guys at Valve found some even more magical to find radial positioning hahaha
Ben Jackson	you typo'd 6MHz as 600kHz at some point
Peter S. Hollander	@Mark Murnane correct, motor angle / timestamp
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr did we just run out of music, that music chat was silly
MobiusHorizons	(no such file)
Jernej Jakob	^^^
Ben Jackson	the saleae protocol decoders are asynchronous and run in another thread
Ben Jackson	so there can be weird latency
Jernej Jakob	maybe it's higher
Mark Murnane	I think you have to derive the motor angle from the window output.
Ben Jackson	I've never tried to use the manchester module
Ben Jackson	it probably would want 6Mhz differential manchester
Mark Murnane	That's a pretty big hint.
tommihommi1	in a few years, software like this will use a neural net to identify the encoding
MobiusHorizons	@CNLohr it's definitely not Manchester üòÉ
Ben Jackson	you sure that's not decoding?
Jernej Jakob	differential manchester is a different option in the drop-down
Ben Jackson	hmm
Peter S. Hollander	Hahahahahaha
tommihommi1	F
Tacit Tacet	when will you be back?
tommihommi1	FFFFFFF
Ben Jackson	silicone labs
daicon	How long did it take you to debug at this level?
Ben Jackson	hmmmm
pacccer	just thinking out loud... but... doesn't wireshark decode a bunch of stuff also? maybe export to csv and import to wireshark
Josiah Tillett	@Everyone 9:15PM EST for the stream to come back online
Blue Speck	use it as a bribe and get a source from an engineer
daicon	learn to^
Peter S. Hollander	@Mark Murnane I know, at least that's what I've been assuming we need to have... But maybe there's another solution we haven't looked at yet.
joejoe4games	Well I won't be joining you then, it's already 23:00 in here in Germany... üòÄ
Praxis	700 for the 8ch one, I paid that much for their 16ch one like a year ago.
Peter S. Hollander	Or maybe it's a 2- or 3-bit header for the lighthouse ID, and then just counting up ticks every transmitted byte (or however long the data is)
pacccer	if we could get an export of the data
pacccer	we could analyze on it
Jernej Jakob	try selecting differential manchester
vihapuu	have you tried sigrok?
Peter S. Hollander	But Ben's really got me thinking each byte is the same, ie an ID.
Mark Murnane	Can you upload the salae file?
Ben Jackson	try differential manchester, 6MHz, one bit per transfer
Peter S. Hollander	lol
Praxis	Export a CSV from Saelae, I know that's possible, right?
Ben Jackson	I wonder if that would work
tommihommi1	you can get a decent 2ch scope from keysight for that price, and then hack it to get all the software options. Might be more useful than a usb analyzer
Ben Jackson	I could find a capture and test
Jernej Jakob	yeah you've got 8 bits per transfer
Peter S. Hollander	Maybe that's the joke.
Peter S. Hollander	lol
tommihommi1	wrong settings
Ben Jackson	maybe it wants 3?
Ben Jackson	does it want 12?
pacccer	i believe salae has \"export csv\"
Ben Jackson	it does
Blue Speck	you could have decoded it manually by now
Tacit Tacet	could you give a quick rundown of how the new lighthouse mechanics works? (or how you think I works at this moment)
schalotten	Try 4 or 8 Mhz
MobiusHorizons	YAY
Ben Jackson	@CNLohr turn off your unused channels to capture

pacccer	hehe
Peter S. Hollander	lol
ibrahim abukharmeh	hahah
pacccer	@Ben Jackson do we need a higher sample rate?
Josiah Tillett	@Peter S. Hollander I think he knows? He disabled them when he exported.
Ben Jackson	@pacccer I just realized when he was exporting that he had all channels on
CNLohr	Error opening file: No such file or directory Unknown track by Unknown artist Unknown copyright information.
Peter S. Hollander	Affirmative.
mcd1992	gitlab has snippets @MobiusHorizons
Ben Jackson	not sure where he captured
Jernej Jakob	disabling them when capturing will give you a higher sample rate option that isn't there otherwise
Praxis	They need to be disable when capturing, not exporting.
ThatsEli	music died again
